    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This macaroni salad recipe is super easy to make. It is very quick too, making it ideal for those times when
        you're in a pinch. The recipe we have listed below is completely vegetarian, but feel free to add your own personal 
        touch with whatever fix-ins you like! 
    </p>
    <p>This dish is perfect for potlucks, picnics, barbecues, and really any other occasion you can think of. It is a cold and
        refreshing dish fit for a summer day. If you have any extra leftovers (you likely won't), make sure to store in the fridge.
